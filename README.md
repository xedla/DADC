# DADC
This repository contains the code to run the experiments present in "The descent-ascent algorithm for DC programming (JOC-2023-05-OA-0142)". The code here is frozen to what it was when we originally wrote the paper. 
Running the commands below should be enough to get all of the results. You need specific versions python, sklearn, numpy, scipy. Install requirements in a virtualenv using:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/xedla/DADC.git
$ cd DADC
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source ./.venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 runme.py
```
